# RelatedWork-SLT
A list of excellent works on various stages of Sign Language Regression and Translation (SLR/SLT) (automatic translation from sign language to gloss or spoken sentences). It contains an extensive literature review on the field of deep learning-based G2T, S2T, S2G2T, and all related publications.

I am gathering these papers as literature for my PhD, and thought others may be interested. If you have any updates, please feel free to contribute or email me at 2021111446@mail.hfut.edu.cn.
